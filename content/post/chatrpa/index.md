# 🤖 ChatRPA: Empowering Automation with AI + RPA

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**ChatRPA** is an intelligent automation assistant that combines the natural language power of **ChatGPT** with the operational efficiency of **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)**. It enables users—whether individuals or enterprises—to describe their task needs in natural language, and have RPA bots automatically execute them.

## 🧠 Key Technologies

| Function             | Technology       |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Prompt Parsing       | ChatGPT / OpenAI |
| Instruction Mapping  | Prompt Engineering |
| Task Execution       | Custom RPA Components (search, type, watch, select, load) |
| Orchestration        | DAG Scheduler + Go backend |
| Interface            | Interactive chat with GPT |

## 🔄 Usage Workflow

1. **User describes task** via chat  
2. **ChatGPT interprets & decomposes** steps  
3. Steps are mapped to **programmatic instructions**  
4. RPA components are dynamically composed  
5. RPA executes task & **returns result to user**

🔁 Users can **revise and re-run** the steps until satisfied.  
☁️ All workflows are saved in the cloud for future reuse.
